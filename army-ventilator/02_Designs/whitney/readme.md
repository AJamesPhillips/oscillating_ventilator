We’ve went back and forth quite a bit on the usefulness of a non-adaptable design, so it seemed like a good idea to focus on putting together a “testable” print instead a “fieldable” one. To deploy something like this we’d want to make it common interfaces, like the ISO Tapered fittings.

Attached are some models for evaluation (physical primarily but also CFD), including the Solidworks and STL files. These parts are designed to be printed as-is, tapped, and glued together. The ports are sized for 1/8” NPT fittings, but a few different pipe threads can fit (if ISO is your preference).

The dimensions are based on  @Alex Izvorski ‘s latest upload, which is quite a bit smaller than the Army report describes. It may be printable by a nice filament printer, but we made need to go with SLS or even polyjet. SLA would probably even work for a prototype. If someone is local to Northeast TN, USA, I can polyjet you a part that would work great.

For the “patient” port, a breathing valve is necessary to allow for a complete expiratory phase, but I believe there’s another thread for 3D printing that piece. For the exhaust port, this is where the “PEEP” valve goes, but for this experiment all that’s needed is a small needle valve (or the like) to increase back pressure. If someone is up to the task of designing a test, we’ll have to clarify some target parameters for PEEP, PIP, Tidal Volume, Respiratory rate, etc., there are a lot of those numbers flying around.

Warren, I’ll get around to adding this to the google doc in the next day or so. If we determine that 1) this works as the Army intended, 2) that it’s as quick and easy to procure as we think, and 3) it’s inadequate as a fixed ratio device, then maybe we could submit the idea to an electronics project to make it more adaptable.

That’s all I got for now. Now please critique away!
